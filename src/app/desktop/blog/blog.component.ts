I would argue tho that the gig economy is not so different from the auto industryâ€™s cycle of layoffs as supply and demand fluctuate. There is also evidence that building (buying) market share is a longterm strategy that yields intangable gains. Amazon took over a decade to turn a profit but what it earned in marketshare in that period is price.  ';
